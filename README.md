# HelloWorldDirectory
A directory of Hello, World in your favorite programming language!

## Why does this exist?!
Simple! I've justed started to learn how to program and very much want to learn git. I don't think I'm ready to contribute to opensource just yet! So I decided to create my own public repo and start researching different programming languages.

## Why hello world?
I've always been interested in programming. It's been interesting going through old, or new, programming languages I've never even heard of and doing the first tutorial to print out "Hello, world!"
