# Hello, World!
A directory of "Hello, World" in your favorite programming language!

### Why does this exist?!
Simple! I've just started to learn how to write code and very much want to learn git but I don't think I'm ready to contribute to opensource just yet! So I decided to create my own public repo and start researching different programming languages.

### Why hello world?
I've always been extremely interested in programming but never made it past the "hello, world" tutorial. It's been interesting going through old, or new, programming languages I've never even heard of and doing the first tutorial to print out "Hello, world!"

### Can I contribute?
Of course! It will be really interesting to see what new programming languages everyone adds!
